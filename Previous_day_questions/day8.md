## 1. String Length and Basics
A problem that introduces fundamental string operations including length calculation and case conversion.

Write a program that takes a string as input and returns its **length** (number of characters). Additionally, convert the string to **uppercase** and **lowercase**, and display both versions along with the original string.

This problem helps you understand **basic string operations** that are fundamental to most string manipulation tasks in programming.

**Your task:** Calculate string length and convert to uppercase and lowercase formats.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
"Hello World"
```
**Output:**
```
Length: 11, Original: "Hello World", Uppercase: "HELLO WORLD", Lowercase: "hello world"
```

---

**Input:**
```
"Python"
```
**Output:**
```
Length: 6, Original: "Python", Uppercase: "PYTHON", Lowercase: "python"
```

---

**Input:**
```
"Programming123"
```
**Output:**
```
Length: 13, Original: "Programming123", Uppercase: "PROGRAMMING123", Lowercase: "programming123"
```

## 2. Character Count
A problem that teaches character frequency counting with case-sensitive matching.

Given a string and a specific character, write a program that counts how many times that character appears in the string. The search should be **case sensitive**, meaning `'A'` and `'a'` are considered different characters.

This type of **character frequency counting** is useful in text analysis, data processing, and many string algorithms.

**Your task:** Count the occurrences of a specific character in a string (case sensitive).

### Examples

**Input:**
```
String: "programming", Character: 'r'
```
**Output:**
```
2
```

---

**Input:**
```
String: "Hello World", Character: 'l'
```
**Output:**
```
3
```

---

**Input:**
```
String: "JavaScript", Character: 'a'
```
**Output:**
```
2
```

## 3. Reverse a String
A fundamental string manipulation problem that teaches character indexing and reversal techniques.

Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string with **all characters in reverse order**. For example, if the input is `"hello"`, the output should be `"olleh"`.

This is a **fundamental string manipulation problem** that helps you understand how to work with **string indexing** and **character manipulation**.

**Your task:** Return the string with all characters in reverse order.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
"hello"
```
**Output:**
```
"olleh"
```

---

**Input:**
```
"world"
```
**Output:**
```
"dlrow"
```

---

**Input:**
```
"12345"
```
**Output:**
```
"54321"
```
