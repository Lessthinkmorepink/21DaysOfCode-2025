## 1. Check Palindrome
A problem that teaches palindrome detection using string comparison and case-insensitive analysis.

A **palindrome** is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same forward and backward. Write a program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. For this basic version, consider only alphabetic characters and **ignore case sensitivity**. Return `true` if the string is a palindrome, `false` otherwise.

**Your task:** Check if a string is a palindrome (case-insensitive, alphabetic characters only).

### Examples

**Input:**
```
"racecar"
```
**Output:**
```
true
```

---

**Input:**
```
"hello"
```
**Output:**
```
false
```

---

**Input:**
```
"Madam"
```
**Output:**
```
true
```

## 2. Count Vowels and Consonants
A problem that teaches character classification and frequency analysis in text processing.

Write a program that takes a string as input and counts the number of **vowels** (a, e, i, o, u) and **consonants** separately. Consider both uppercase and lowercase letters. **Ignore any non-alphabetic characters** like numbers, spaces, or special symbols.

This helps in **text analysis** and understanding the **composition of words**.

**Your task:** Count vowels and consonants separately, ignoring non-alphabetic characters.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
"hello"
```
**Output:**
```
Vowels: 2, Consonants: 3
```

---

**Input:**
```
"Programming"
```
**Output:**
```
Vowels: 3, Consonants: 8
```

---

**Input:**
```
"aeiou"
```
**Output:**
```
Vowels: 5, Consonants: 0
```

## 3. Find First Non-Repeating Character
A problem that combines character frequency analysis with string traversal techniques.

Given a string, find the **first character** that appears **only once** in the string. If all characters repeat or the string is empty, return a special indicator like `-1` or `None`.

This problem is commonly used in interviews and helps understand **character frequency analysis** and **string traversal techniques**.

**Your task:** Find the first character that appears only once, or return -1 if none exists.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
"programming"
```
**Output:**
```
'p'
```

---

**Input:**
```
"aabbcc"
```
**Output:**
```
-1
```

---

**Input:**
```
"abccba"
```
**Output:**
```
-1
```
